This code takes input as an argument in the command line which acts as the key for the program
Ill explain how this works with an example, lets say the key is 4. the program will then ask for a string input. after getting the string input, it will iterate through the string and add 4 to the ASCII value to all the character and print a ciphered string that can be deciphered only with the key
